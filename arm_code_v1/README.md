ARM PROTOTYPE CODE README

The idea behind this programn is too receive inputs from the serial3 and convert them into commands sent to the 
servo imputs


Input received: -Analog input from two joysticks(will be there position with respect to the center)
				-Left and right bumper imputs from ps3 controllers

Design overview:

Analog controllers will supply a voltage to the servos which will cause them to turn at a constant speed either backwards or forwards

**CONTROL OVERVIEW**

ANALOG INPUT(LEFT): UP---SHOULDER DOWN||DOWN---SHOULDER UP
ANALOG INPUT(RIGHT): UP---ELBOW DOWN||DOWN---ELBOW UP
LEFT BUMPER: BASE SERVO LEFT
RIGHT BUMPER: BASE SERVO RIGHT
